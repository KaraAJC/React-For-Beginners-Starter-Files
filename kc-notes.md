# Kara's Notes

Here's a list of what I've learned so far, and things I've been curious about, to review later!

*note: I've also commented up a lot of the work I've done as I go through lessons, so that's also useful info!*

## Environment Needs:
- Node
- Code Editor package `babel` 
- Chrome React Tools extension

## Components:
components are chunks of reuseable code that are setup to do lots of things, default to prepare a chunk of code to be rendered to the main JS file. 

there are two different types of components you can have. a **Functional** Component, and a **Class** Component. 

You can look at components that people have made with `React Dev Tools` by navigating to a react-built side and going to the `React` tab. from there, you can inspect a component, often shown by it's `<ComponentName\>` tag
